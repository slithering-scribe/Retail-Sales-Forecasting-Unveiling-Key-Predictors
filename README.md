By understanding the underlying patterns and trends, this project seeks to optimize sales strategies and improve decision-making processes.

Key Features
Data Analysis: Conducts exploratory data analysis to uncover insights and patterns.

Feature Engineering: Creates new features to capture more information and improve model performance.

Model Building: Implements various machine learning models including Linear Regression, Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks, and XGBoost.

Model Evaluation: Evaluates models using metrics such as MSE and R2 Score to determine the best-performing model.

Ensemble Methods: Combines multiple models to enhance prediction accuracy.

Project Structure
Data: Contains the dataset and any preprocessing scripts.

Notebooks: Includes Jupyter notebooks for data analysis, model building, and evaluation.

Models: Stores trained models and related scripts.

Reports: Provides detailed reports on findings and model performances.

Visualizations: Contains visualizations that help interpret the data and model results.

How to Use
1. Clone the Repository:
bash
Copy: git clone [repository link]

2. Install Dependencies:
